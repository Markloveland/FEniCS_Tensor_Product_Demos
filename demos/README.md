#Jupyter Notebook Demos

##Each notebook is self-contained and corresponds to each problem from the paper 

###Problem1_Poisson_4D.ipynb: Test case 1 from the paper where domain is Cartesian product of 2 unit squares

###Problem2_Wave_Spacetime.ipynb: Test case 2 from the paper where the domain is Cartesian product of a unit square for space and a unit interval for time

###Problem3_ADR_SUPG.ipynb: Test case 3 from the paper where the domain is a Cartesian product of two unit intervals, an advection dominated problem using SUPG technique

###Problem4_Poisson_Varying.ipynb: Test case 4 from the paper where the domain is a Cartesian product of two unit intervals, and includes an operator that is non-separable
