# FEniCS_Tensor_Product_Demos

A repository containing Jupyter Notebook tutorials of all test cases run in the paper:
"Extending FEniCS to Work in Higher Dimensions Using Tensor Product Finite Elements"

All notebooks can be run with the most recent FEniCS installation.
I would reccommend either installation through docker https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/jupyter.html or via conda https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fenics

The version used for these particular tests was the installation via docker which is version 2019.1.0

demos/ folder contains ipynb tutorials for the numerical tests in the paper, all notebooks are self contained and should only need a FEniCS installation to run
